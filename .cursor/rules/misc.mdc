# Miscellaneous Conventions

1. Use TypeScript for all files.
1. Only use types, not interfaces.
1. Do not use `any` type.
1. Use `undefined` over `null`.
1. Do not add any comments to the code that you generate.
1. Follow consistent naming conventions:
    - Folders: camelCase (`intercept`, `replay`, `httpHistory`).
    - Component folders: PascalCase (`PassiveFormCreate`, `PassiveTable`).
    - All other files: camelCase (`useForm.ts`, `assistant.graphql`).
1. Declare variables close to their usage:
    - Avoid declaring all variables at the top of functions/files.
    - Place variable declarations as close as possible to where they are first used.
    - Group related variables together (e.g., event bus declarations next to their corresponding listeners).
1. When refactoring, avoid creating alias types like this:
```
export type Options = ScanConfig;
```
Instead, actually rename the type and fix all occurences if needed.
