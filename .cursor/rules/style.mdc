## UI Style Guidelines

### PrimeVue

* Prefer to use PrimeVue compontents if possible and can make our life easier
* A Caido custom PrimeVue is already set up. It has dark mode as a default and handles most colors related styles for us.

### General Theme

* **Dark Mode** is default — all UI elements follow a dark, low-contrast background with light text for high readability.
* For tailwind colors, prefer to use `...-surface-...` f.e. `border-surface-700`.
* Caido uses `bg-surface-800` as the main app background, `bg-surface-700` is the background for cards.
* UI colors are subtle and minimalistic. We try to avoid too much colors if possible.

### Layout & Components
* We often use **split panes** (vertical or horizontal)
* Keep in mind that we are building a plugin that's inside a Caido web app, we can modify frontend by adding sidebar pages using Caido Frontend SDK.
* Prefer to use `Card` PrimeVue components a lot, if needed add `h-full` to them via `pt` params.

### Data Representation

* Prefer **data tables** for displaying structured data:
  * Sticky headers with sorting options.
  * Actions column at the end (e.g. “Install” buttons).
* Empty states use friendly, minimal messages with soft icons.

### Hackers-Focused Design

* Prioritize fast access to tools: tabs, filters, and search bars are always visible and contextual.
* UI feedback is subtle — no popups; changes reflect instantly in-line.


### Other, Important

* Prefer to use :class="{ ... }" Vue syntax for conditional styling classes instead of separating function unless the logic is so complex that it's the cleaner way.
* Keep logic inline for simple cases; extract to computed or helper for reuse or clarity.
